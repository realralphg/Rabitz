Their collection, likewise, began as a series of one-off items from local thrift stores that the women revitalized themselves. “The whole idea was about not being able to afford expensive clothing, combined with our peers and lecturers always telling us we looked great and should start something,” says Mothoa.`,

He told OkayAfrica, "I started working on it August [of 2019]. At some point I had to go off social media, stay away from a lot of things and keep my head straight to get the project right. The first song I'd recorded on Get Layd was 'Bad Influence.' I'd done that way before the songs we had to put on the project." Following the break, he released "Bad Influence," which became the most streamed Nigerian song on Apple Music at the end of 2020. On 14 February 2020, Lay released "You," his first official single.

            "I’m weary of lockdown, like you probably are. But reopening the economy is something that must be done carefully, thoughtfully, and cautiously — not carelessly, thoughtlessly, and recklessly. Or else, disaster can all too easily be added atop catastrophe. What kind of sense does it make to reopen the economy before the death toll has even peaked? While it’s still climbing? Won’t that just…pour fuel on the fire? It doesn’t take a genius to see that reopening the economy at such a juncture — before the disease has even slowed in any significant way — will only cause the pandemic to spread faster and further, infecting more people, causing more deaths, and igniting subsequent waves and peaks. Bang! You’ve now made both problems worse. Public health, and the economy. By trying to bully and force a whole society back to work…you’re going to cause the very depression you’re trying to avert…and add a historic, gigantic public health tragedy to it, too. You’ve created the worst of all worlds. The way to do that, of course, is to treat healthcare as a basic right, which everyone in society is provided, and therefore becomes a matter of social investment, a real public good. During pandemics like this we see clearly the power of public goods. Countries like Germany, with spare capacity in hospital beds, see vastly lower death tolls, whereas countries like America, where healthcare was unobtainable to begin with, see especially horrific. ones. America’s response to Coronavirus has been a shambles and a disgrace. First, its government did nothing. Then, it did nothing some more. Then, it offered people one week of support. Now, it’s forcing people back to work, to reopen the economy — not understanding that doing so is how to trigger a depression, not avoid one, and how to create a massive, historic public health tragedy, too.

          In an interview with Sunday Scoop, Samklef stated that he spoke out because of other producers that were ‘suffering in silence’. He said, “You describe it as ‘call out’. But, for me, it is just me voicing out. A lot of producers are suffering in silence and I am not happy about it. Shizzi, my brother, (also a producer) has also voiced out his frustrations. (I believe) more is coming.”

          Samklef also stated that he declared his intention to run for the office of the President of Nigeria because it was time to stop complaining, and start acting. He said, “Leadership is a responsibility and not a right. I believe every responsible Nigerian should be able to run for any (elective) position as provided and supported by the constitution. We have done enough of complaining. I declared to run in order to inspire other young able Nigerians that might be nursing political ambitions. I have helped with a seven-point agenda and I believe we would see many young people declaring (their intentions).”

          Asked if he believed that a young Nigerian stood the chance of leading the nation, he said, “It starts with the mind. If you believe it, you would achieve it. Nigeria cannot change in four years. That is why we need a young person that has a lot at stake and still has reasons to stay alive to run the country. Check my agenda; it has plans for 25 years.”

          On if he feels misunderstood by people, Samklef said, “Even Jesus was misunderstood, so I pay more attention to those that understand what I am saying and are in the same realm as me.”`,

          longerDesc: `Nigerian singer Bankole Wellington, popularly known as Banky W, who is vying for a seat in the House of Representatives to represent the Eti-Osa federal constituency in Lagos State, has said that despite the prospect of being outspent by other aspirants, he stands a chance to win the seat due to his sense of vision.Banky W argued that he was not defeated in the 2019 elections but succeeded in “planting a seed” in the collective consciousness of Nigerian youths ahead of the 2023 elections.

          Wellington disclosed this to journalists at the Peoples Democratic Party’s Wadata Plaza secretariat in Abuja when he obtained his expression of interest and nomination forms for N600,000.

          He argued that Nigerian youths could no longer afford to can sit and complain but must join mainstream political platforms that give them the chance to play a part in rebuilding the nation.

          On his chances in the forthcoming elections, he said, “In a David and Goliath situation, I’m more comfortable being David. You know, the stakes are high, the big machine is against us, but I do believe that what we may lack in money we have in meaning. We have a mission. We have a message.

          “I think that if Lagosians are truly happy with the way everything is happening, then maybe we don’t stand a chance. But somehow I suspect that that’s not the case and that people are ready for something fresh, something different, something unique, something that speaks to the heart of someone who wants to serve and who wants to see the nation better. “So I’m content to stand on my own two feet with the support of the PDP and the support of our young people and the support of my community in saying that, because I know that we represent something different.”

          Speaking of the antecedents leading to his defeat in the 2019 elections, Wellington noted that although he declared his candidacy only three months before election day, he still nailed the third spot in the race.

          “You said that 2019 was unsuccessful, and I completely disagree. If you recall in 2019, I didn’t declare for office until three months before election day, which is completely unheard of.

          “So for us in 2019, it wasn’t about winning a seat. It was about planting a seed. And I think we successfully did that because what we did was, we came third, and we won in some wards and polling units that were previous strongholds for either of the two big parties.

          “But at that time, it was about showing young people that this is something we have to get involved in even though we’re late to the race. We just planted a seed, let’s just stick our toe in the waters,” he explained.

          The aspirant also noted that he chose to run on the platform of the PDP because the party opened its arms to youths.

          “I believe that with the PDP there’s a genuine intention to give young people a seat at the table? I believe that we have a chance to build a bridge between those who have been in the political terrain for many years and those of us who’ve been protesting from the sidelines.

          “I believe that the PDP is welcoming us with open arms and open doors. And so, I’m grateful to the party for the warm reception,” Banky W stated.`,
